Re-calculated all because methodology used before was not consistent and 2016 values were not calculated. Used body length for all biomass calculations when body length was available, but would use head width coeficients if body length was not available (checks were done - strong corelation between 2 (r>0.75)); taxa column was re-arranged so that whatever the highest level of organismal classifcation that was matched in the DRY_MASS_EQUATION table was used for purposes of calculating dry mass -- community information still preserved through other classification columns; 267 observations were removed from existing table due to duplication or error"

There are also new columns for firstname, lastname, and nickname, as well as affiliation (e.g. name of university) and notes (e.g. there was one person for whom CREW had a note about what work they did). In addition, I standardized spellings (e.g. Caceres-Velasquez --> Caceres-Velazquez) and made sure that if a person had a nickname, every row mentioning that person had the same pair of values for firstname and nickname.
