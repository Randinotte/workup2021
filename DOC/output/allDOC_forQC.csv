Samples stored in refrigerator and vials were parafilmed. First run failed on TOC machine due to mechanical error with no recoverable data. Approx. 15ml of remaining sample was preserved for use in second sampling attempt (this one). Number of injections reduced from 3-5 to 3-4 to reduce sample volume needed. May slightly increase variability between replicates and reduce presicion of DOC_mgL average. Likely not a problem except at very low levels (<5mgL)",NA,"tableDOC_2020.20201118"
