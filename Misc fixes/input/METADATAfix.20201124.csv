Typically, each data file contains 5 peaks in the following order: standard (1000ppm), atmosphere, pCO2 rep1, rep2, rep3.  These peaks were identified from the raw data using Stuart's R script IRGA_pCO2_analysis_12-13-11.r.  This script calculates ppm values for each peak using the peak heights.  pCO2 calculations were then done in the R script pco2_2011.r.  ppm values for replicate pCO2 samples for each lake were averaged and then converted to um/L using the bunsen headspace calculations (R script ppm2umol).  Atmosphere ppm values were used as the source gas in the headspace calculations.  Atmosphere ppm values were averaged for each sampling date regardless of the lake at which they were sampled.  This assumes that atmosphere CO2 is the same everywhere at UNDERC and allows for a better estimate than using a single value.
